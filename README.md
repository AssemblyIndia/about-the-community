# About the community

![Assembly Logo](/images/logo.png)

Assembly is and aims to be a community for developers and programmers from across the globe, built and governed by the principles of **TheThirdPillar**. The primary focus of the community is to nurture **quality developers with strong computer science fundamentals**. The members can choose their own learning paths and resources to reach their goals. We learn as a group, therefore, each topic/subjects will see learning circles in action often. Once skilled enough, members can join others developers for opportunities of paid work. 

Topics to develop strong fundamentals:

- Data Structures
- Algorithms - Analysis and Development
- Computer Systems and Organization
- Operating Systems
- Networking and Security
- Cryptography
- Machine Learning and Neural Network
- Software Engineering

Programming Languages: ( Ideally, we would have each of the above topic covered by these languages)

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- GoLang
- C/C++
- Bash
